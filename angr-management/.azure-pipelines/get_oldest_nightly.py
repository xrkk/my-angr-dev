To avoid clutter in the releases tab on GitHub, this script has been written to
pick an old release to delete, which is passed to a GitHubRelease task in
./nightly.yml. It doesn't handle cases there are multiple old releases, but
since this script is run after every nightly release, that shouldn't be a real
issue.
